## Hi!

I like to code and I like to talk about code. Interesting projects keep me up at night, and I love to try out new technologies.

I use JS/TS the most, but I'm also familiar with, and use to varying degrees, Python, Go, C++, C#, and a couple others.


## Things I Do

### Tachi

Tachi is a rhythm game score tracker, and one of the largest projects I've been a part of. The site itself is a MERN stack: I handle the infrastructure and DevOps side of things, making use of Docker + Docker Swarm for scaling, plus handling both self-hosted and cloud infrastructure like our MongoDB and Redis instances.

### USC IR

USC IR is a specification for internet ranking for the game unnamed_sdvx_clone. I co-authored the specification with zkldi and Drewol, then implemented the specification in the game as well as creating an example webserver implementing the protocol.

### Other Things!

Some of the things I've worked on are not on my GitHub profile for a variety of reasons: for example, my final year project is not allowed to be public yet lest a plagiarism tracker pick it up and accuse me of stealing 100% of my work from myself. But they're super cool as well: my final year project is a full-stack web application built with SvelteKit, which allows a class of students to learn programming by collaboratively controlling a Parrot-brand drone using a simple domain-specific language designed by me.


## Things I Love

### MongoDB

MongoDB just makes sense to me. The document model of databases fits my brain like a glove.

### Express

When it comes to the NPM ecosystem, express was truly my first love. It's so easy to build things in, both prototypes and at scale.

### Svelte

I love Svelte so much. My friends generally call me the insane one for *enjoying* front-end development, but it's where you see the application really come to life in colour, form and function. Svelte strips away a lot of the boilerplate and lets me focus on exactly what I want to do, and it's lightning fast to boot. What's not to love?
